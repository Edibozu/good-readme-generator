# Good ReadMe Generator

## Description

With this application, the user is able to dynamically create a ReadMe by answering a few simple questions. The code then takes the user's inputs and places them in an organized and formatted template. 

## Installation

The application is found within this repo and can be easily cloned. Next, open file in VS Code, and run `node index.js` within the terminal. This will prompt the questions that the user has to answer, and when completed, a .md file will be created containing the all of the information provided.
<br/><br/><br/>
The screenshot below shows the prompt questions being asked once `node index.js` has been ran inside the terminal.
